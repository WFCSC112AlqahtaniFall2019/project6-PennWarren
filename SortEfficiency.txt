InsertionSort using LinkedLists was pretty inefficient, especially compared to some of the algorithms we’ve used in the past. I had planned to test the sorting algorithm with 10000, incrementing by 100, but it took a ridiculous amount of time and I decided to stop the program after 5000. By the time it was 4700, the algorithm spiked to two and a half minutes in run time and the final iteration took 175 seconds! 

Relative to other sort algorithms, LinkedList’s InsertionSort was horrible: BubbleSort was faster at size 100,000 than InsertionSort was at 5,000. For this assignment in particular, we compared the InsertionSort with vectors to the InsertionSort with LinkedLists. LinkedList’s function could compete (and was occasionally faster) for sizes under 20, but after that it became increasingly inefficient compared to its vector counterpart.
